User interfaces are the way in which we communicate to computers and software our desires. There are two types of user interfaces, GUI and CLI. 
A GUI or Guided User Interface is what you will find in many software apps and on your electronics operating systems and consists of buttons and icons. 
A CLI on the other hand (Command line interface) takes our commands in the form of text and code. An example is windows powershell and command prompt,
 which is on all windows pcs. 

Both types of user interfaces have their place. For example GUI's have the advantage of being easy to use, and easy to understand through their visual representation.
On the other hand CLI's are much faster and consume much less resources. However they have the disadvantage of having a steep learning curve and being unintuitive.
While GUI's can limit you in functionality, CLI's can leave you wondering what to do in the first place. 

I personally don't see either of these going anywhere anytime soon, though maybe in the far future the only user interface will be a prompt with an ai?
