In my opinion there is no other option than learning style affecting how we learn. They are quite literally the ways we learn.
Personally I am more of a visual and kinesthetic learner. I have memories of sitting in math class as a kid completely lost on what
the teacher is droning on about. However as soon as the teacher actually started working problems on the board, it would all of a sudden click.

Even today, as an accounting major I'll something in a textbook and have absolotuly no clue what is going on, but let me do a practice problem about it
and I'll have it down pat lickity split.

I honestly believe a lot of students feel stupid because they don't learn well through auditory or reading styles. Luckily it seems that
many colleges and schools in the US are moving away from this style to a more discussion based style.
